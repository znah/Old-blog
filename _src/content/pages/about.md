Title: About

Hello!
My name is Alexander Mordvintsev. I'm a software engineer/researcher living in
Saint-Petersburg, Russia. My main professional interests lie in the field of Computer
Vision. Also I keep an eye on things going on in Computer Graphics and
High Performance Computing worlds. My weapons of choice are [Python](http://python.org) 
and [friends](http://enthought.com/products/epdlibraries.php) 
([numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) ...), C++ and GPUs.

This page contains notes and videos of some of my experiments.
